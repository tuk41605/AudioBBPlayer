Some things to take into account:

1. The search button's alignment seems to be off, but it does work. Attempt to click near the top or to the far right or left to use it.
2. As mentioned in the professor's PlayerService README, the pause button will also play if streaming is already paused. The play button only seems to work when
loading a new book into the player or after pressing the stop button.
3. When switching books, it might be necessary to wait a short duration after pressing the play button while the book loads.
